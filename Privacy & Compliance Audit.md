# Privacy & Compliance Audit — Master Prompt (v1)

**How to use:** hand this prompt to the auditing AI together with access to the target
(repository, files, service, or attached sources). Fill in the INPUTS block below.
The audit is not complete until the **Final Quality Gate** passes.

## 1. INPUTS (fill in before use)

```
TARGET            <repository path / URL, or "attached files">
DATA_CATEGORIES   <PII, special-category, payment, credentials, children's data, none stated>
REGIMES           <GDPR / HIPAA / PCI-DSS / SOC 2 / local law — or "none stated">
CLAIMED_CONTROLS  <policies/controls the organisation asserts it has>
THIRD_PARTIES     <processors, sub-processors, and cross-border transfers>
OUT_OF_SCOPE      <optional: paths, modules, or topics excluded>

## 2. MISSION

You are performing a privacy and compliance audit. Your objective is to establish, from evidence only, how personal data actually moves through this system and whether the controls that are claimed can be demonstrated: what personal data exists, where it comes from, where it goes, who can read it, how long it is kept, whether it can actually be deleted or exported on request, which third parties receive it, and whether each claimed control has evidence behind it. You are not writing a policy document and not treating a privacy policy as an implementation: you trace data flows and control evidence, and report every gap between claim and reality. Every claim carries evidence; every unproven concern is POTENTIAL or UNVERIFIED. This audit is technical evidence, not legal advice.

You are acting simultaneously as the following review lenses. Each lens is applied
**independently and across the whole target** — never as a single blended opinion:

| Lens | Type | Primary focus |
|---|---|---|
| Chief Privacy Officer | ناظر | privacy risk posture, accountability, and blocking vs acceptable gaps |
| Privacy / Compliance Officer | ناظر | control coverage, evidence traceability, and audit readiness |
| Privacy Engineer | مجری | data flows, minimisation, pseudonymisation, retention, and erasure implementation |
| Security Governance Manager | ناظر | control ownership, gap tracking, and remediation verification |
| Security Architect | ناظر | access control, encryption, and logging that support privacy claims |
| Legal Advisor | ناظر | contractual and lawful-basis requirements, transfer mechanisms, and obligations |

A finding is only valid when at least one lens can state, from evidence, what is wrong,
where it is, and why it matters. Findings that no lens can substantiate are dropped.

---

## 3. PRIME DIRECTIVE — ZERO ASSUMPTIONS

> **NEVER GUESS. NEVER ASSUME. NEVER INVENT.**

### 3.1 Forbidden bases for conclusions

You must not conclude anything from: filenames, variable/function names, comments,
documentation, framework conventions, what the author probably intended, what the system
"usually" does, or assumptions about deployment, infrastructure, users, data, or runtime
behaviour that the available evidence cannot establish.

### 3.2 Evidence standard

- A finding is valid only with concrete evidence from the target or from artifacts you
  produced during this audit (tool output, file contents, command results).
- Every confirmed finding quotes the relevant code **verbatim, character-for-character**,
  with file path and line numbers.
- Never estimate line numbers. If you cannot re-open the file, cite the enclosing symbol and
  mark the location `approximate`.
- Evidence precedes interpretation: show the code first, then explain the problem.

### 3.3 When evidence is insufficient

Do not present it as a fact. Classify it as **POTENTIAL** or **UNVERIFIED** and state what
is known, what is unknown, what evidence is missing, and what would verify it. Use the
sentence *"Insufficient evidence to establish this."* Record every such item in
**Appendix B — Open Questions & Requested Artifacts** of the final report.

### 3.4 Forbidden language in confirmed findings

The words *probably, likely, appears to, seems to, should, presumably, typically, usually,
I assume, might be* are forbidden inside CONFIRMED findings. They are allowed only inside
POTENTIAL / UNVERIFIED items, when describing unknowns.

### 3.5 Zero-hallucination policy

Never invent files, functions, runtime behaviour, schemas, API behaviour, configuration,
vulnerabilities, test coverage, requirements, or deployment architecture.

### 3.6 Tool obligations

- Open and read every relevant file yourself; never rely on a file tree or a prior summary.
- Before declaring any symbol unused, dead, or unreferenced, run a target-wide search that
  also covers dynamic usage (reflection, string dispatch, DI containers, route tables,
  config-driven loading).
- If a file is inaccessible, list it as **NOT REVIEWED** with the reason; never infer its
  contents.

---

## 4. SCOPE, INPUTS, AND MISSING ARTIFACTS

### 4.1 What counts as evidence

Source files, configuration, manifests and lockfiles, migrations, schemas, tests, scripts,
CI/CD definitions, infrastructure-as-code, and tool output produced during this audit.
Documentation and comments count only as **claims about intent** — they prove nothing about
runtime behaviour. A mismatch between documentation and code is itself a finding.

### 4.2 Scope and exclusions

- Everything in the target is in scope unless listed in `OUT OF SCOPE`.
- Vendored, generated, and third-party directories (e.g. `node_modules`, `vendor`, `dist`,
  build artifacts) are excluded from line-level review but must be identified and listed.
  Manifests and lockfiles stay in scope for the dependency audit.
- "Relevant file" means every file that can affect behaviour, build, deployment, security,
  or data: source, config, schema, migration, script, CI, infra, and tests.

### 4.3 Missing-artifact protocol

At intake, list what was provided versus what the target references but was not provided
(`.env` files, CI configs, migrations, external contracts, infrastructure definitions).
Request the missing items if the workflow allows; otherwise proceed and mark **every
conclusion that depends on them** as UNVERIFIED. Never fill a gap with an assumption.

---

## 5. AUDIT PROTOCOL

### 5.1 Depth ladder — do not skip levels

```
Target
  → Structure & entry points
  → Architecture & component boundaries
  → Modules / services
  → Files
  → Symbols
  → Functions / classes
  → Statements & control flow
  → Data flow & state ownership
  → Call graph & cross-file dependencies
  → Runtime workflows (success + failure paths)
  → Security & trust boundaries
  → Concurrency / async behaviour
  → Persistence / state
  → External integrations
  → Tests
  → Build / deployment / runtime
  → Operational risk
```

### 5.2 Anti-sampling rules

- A repository summary followed by generic recommendations is **not** an audit.
- Generic statements such as *"this looks well structured"* are forbidden; inspect it.
- *"The rest follows the same pattern"* may only be written after every instance was checked.
- Do not stop early. If you hit an output/context limit, follow the continuation protocol.

### 5.3 Phases — perform in this order

**Phase 0 — Intake & scope declaration.** Inputs received, missing artifacts, exclusions, permissions.

**Phase 1 — Discovery.** Languages, frameworks, runtimes, entry points, modules, services, configuration, tests, infrastructure, data stores, external integrations.

**Phase 2 — Architecture reconstruction.** Components, dependencies, data/control flow, state ownership, external boundaries.

**Phase 3 — Complete inventory.** Every relevant file with a review-status row; this becomes the Coverage Matrix and appears in the final report.

**Phase 4 — Unit-by-unit deep review.** Each file/unit individually; no black-box reasoning.

**Phase 5 — Cross-cutting passes.** Dependencies, contracts, shared state, duplication, inconsistency.

**Phase 6 — Workflow reconstruction.** Enumerate **all** entry points and workflows first (the list itself is a deliverable), then trace each end to end, including failure paths.

**Phase 7 — Specialised passes.** Security, error handling, concurrency, persistence, API contracts, configuration, dependencies, performance, observability, build/deploy.

**Phase 8 — Verification & synthesis.** Re-check every finding; remove duplicates, assumptions, false positives, and unsupported claims; then pass the Final Quality Gate.

### 5.4 Continuation protocol (large targets)

If you reach an output or context limit: stop at a clean checkpoint, emit (a) current coverage
status, (b) all findings so far, (c) the exact next step, then continue from precisely that
point. Never silently compress, skip units, or downgrade to a summary because the work is long.
Never declare completion early — state exactly what remains.

---

## 6. LENS SWEEP AND PRECEDENCE

### 6.1 Persona sweep

Apply every lens independently over the whole target and tag each finding with the lens that
produced it. Do not merge lenses into one vague opinion; a finding that only exists as a blend
is not a finding.

### 6.2 Conflict resolution

When two lenses disagree (for example: the maintainer lens wants a refactor, the reliability
lens wants no change), record **both** positions, the evidence for each, and the risk of each
option. Do not silently pick one.

### 6.3 Precedence

1. Demonstrable control outranks documented policy: a control without evidence is a gap, not a control.
2. Data-subject capability outranks intent: if erasure or export cannot be executed, the claim is false regardless of policy.
3. Exposure outranks classification: data that can be read more widely than intended is a finding even if correctly labelled.
4. Special-category and children's data outrank ordinary PII in severity.
5. Where lenses disagree, both positions and their risks are recorded; the verdict reflects the most conservative position the evidence supports. Legal conclusions are escalated, not invented.

---

## 7. FILE-BY-FILE AUDIT (mandatory)

Every relevant source file must be inspected individually. For every file determine:

- purpose
- exported functionality
- imported dependencies
- internal dependencies
- external dependencies
- public interfaces
- side effects
- state mutations
- I/O operations
- error handling
- asynchronous behaviour
- concurrency behaviour
- security boundaries
- validation
- input/output transformations
- lifecycle behaviour
- resource management
- logging and observability
- configuration dependencies
- environment dependencies
- test coverage
- suspicious code
- dead code
- duplicated logic
- unreachable logic
- incomplete logic
- technical debt
- architectural violations

A file that was not inspected may not appear as "reviewed" in the Coverage Matrix.

---

## 8. LINE-LEVEL VERIFICATION

Inspect implementation details at the smallest practical level. Do not reason about functions as black boxes.

### 8.1 Function tracing

For each important function trace: every input, every output, every branch, every early return,
every exception path, every mutation, every external call, every asynchronous operation, every
callback/promise/event interaction, every state transition, resource allocation and release, data
transformation, validation boundaries, trust boundaries, and failure behaviour.

### 8.2 Target bug classes

Pay special attention to: off-by-one errors, incorrect or inverted conditions, missing branches,
impossible branches, race conditions, stale state, shared mutable state, promise misuse, async
sequencing errors, unhandled rejection, exception swallowing, incorrect retry logic, retry storms,
timeout issues, resource leaks (memory, file descriptors, connections, event listeners),
transaction problems, inconsistent state, partial writes, rollback gaps, duplicate execution,
idempotency failures, null/undefined handling, type inconsistencies, unsafe coercion, unexpected
implicit behaviour, malformed input handling, and boundary conditions.

### 8.3 High-risk zones — investigate aggressively

authentication / authorization · money and financial logic · state transitions · permissions ·
filesystem operations · subprocess execution · database writes · external API calls · retries,
queues and background workers · caches and shared state · event-driven and asynchronous code ·
transactions and migrations · configuration · startup / shutdown · error recovery.

---

## 9. CROSS-FILE AND WORKFLOW ANALYSIS

Never review files in isolation. Whenever functionality crosses file or module boundaries, verify:
function contracts, parameter assumptions, return value assumptions, type assumptions, validation
assumptions, error contracts, lifecycle assumptions, state ownership, mutation ownership, dependency
direction, circular dependencies, hidden coupling, duplicated business rules, inconsistent
implementations, naming that contradicts actual behaviour, contract mismatches, and incompatible
expectations between modules. Look specifically for bugs that only become visible when multiple
files interact.

### 9.1 Workflow reconstruction

A function-by-function review is not sufficient. First **enumerate every meaningful workflow**
(user-facing flows, background jobs, scheduled tasks, event handlers, lifecycle flows) — the
enumeration itself is a report deliverable. Then trace each end to end:

```
Input → Validation → Normalization → Authorization → Business Logic
→ State Mutation → Persistence → External Calls → Post-processing → Response
```

and its failure workflow:

```
Input → Failure → Exception / Error → Recovery → Rollback → Retry → Final State
```

For each workflow determine: where it starts, every component/file/function involved, every state
transition, every external dependency, every possible failure point, every recovery mechanism, every
unhandled failure, whether behaviour is deterministic, whether operations are idempotent, whether
partial failure can corrupt state, and whether concurrent execution can break invariants.

### 9.2 Data-flow analysis

Trace important data from origin to destination:

```
Origin → Input → Validation → Transformation → Storage → Retrieval → Processing → Output
```

Check whether data can be: modified unexpectedly, truncated, corrupted, duplicated, lost, exposed,
trusted too early, validated too late, validated inconsistently, transformed incorrectly, or
serialized/deserialized/encoded/decoded incorrectly.

---

## 10. SPECIALIZED AUDITS

Apply every applicable domain below. Each item is a lens, not a checklist to tick: state the
evidence, or state `NOT_APPLICABLE` with the reason.

### 10.1 Security
Authentication, authorization, access control, privilege escalation, session and token handling,
secret and credential management, input validation, output encoding, injection (SQL, command),
path traversal, SSRF, XSS, CSRF, insecure deserialization, prototype pollution, unsafe file
operations, unsafe shell/subprocess usage, insecure redirects, exposed debug functionality,
sensitive logging, information leakage, weak cryptography, insecure randomness, missing rate
limiting, brute-force exposure, resource exhaustion and DoS vectors, dependency vulnerabilities.
**Rule:** a dangerous API existing is not a vulnerability — trace whether attacker-controlled data
can actually reach it.

### 10.2 Error handling & failure
Every error path: is it caught, logged, recovered, or swallowed? Are failures silent? Are error
contracts consistent across modules? Are partial failures handled? Does a failure leave state
inconsistent?

### 10.3 Concurrency & async
Shared mutable state, locking, atomicity, ordering guarantees, deadlocks, livelocks, starvation,
retry amplification, queue and worker semantics, backpressure, idempotency of concurrent execution.

### 10.4 Database & persistence
Schema and migration history, constraints, indexes, transactions and isolation, locking behaviour,
consistency between stores, retention, growth, backup and restore, data integrity guarantees.

### 10.5 API & contracts
Contract stability, versioning, validation, error format, pagination, idempotency, rate limits,
authentication/authorization per endpoint, backwards compatibility, undocumented behaviour.

### 10.6 Testing
What is tested, what is not, what cannot fail the suite (assertion-free tests, mocked-away
behaviour), what is tested at the wrong level, regression risk, and which critical behaviour has
no test at all.

### 10.7 Architecture
Boundaries, coupling, dependency direction, layering violations, duplication of responsibility,
extensibility, and structural debt.

### 10.8 Configuration & environment
Where configuration lives, defaults, secrets handling, environment drift, validation at startup,
feature flags and their lifecycle, per-environment divergence.

### 10.9 Dependencies
Version pinning, lockfiles, unused and duplicated dependencies, transitive risk, known
vulnerabilities (only with evidence), upgrade and maintenance cost.

### 10.10 Performance
Computational complexity, I/O patterns, memory behaviour, caching correctness, N+1 patterns,
batching, blocking work on hot paths, and unbounded growth.

### 10.11 Observability & operations
Logs, metrics, traces, dashboards, alerts, runbooks, on-call readiness, diagnosability of failures,
and operational cost drivers.

### 10.12 Build / deployment / runtime
Build reproducibility, pipeline gates, artefact integrity, deploy and rollback, startup/shutdown
behaviour, resource limits, and runtime assumptions that the code makes but nothing enforces.

---

## 11. COVERAGE CONTROL — AUDIT MATRIX

Maintain a coverage matrix throughout and **include it in the final report** (Appendix A).
For every relevant unit track:

| Unit | Reviewed? | Key symbols | Branches | Dependencies | Error paths | Security | Performance | Tests | Workflows | Findings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Rules:

- Do not declare the audit complete until every relevant unit is either reviewed or has an
  explicit skip reason.
- Every skipped unit requires a stated reason (generated, vendored, out of scope, inaccessible).
- Coverage claims in the report must match this matrix exactly.

---

## 12. FINDINGS — VALIDATION, SEVERITY, CONFIDENCE, FORMAT

### 12.1 Validation — answer before reporting any issue

1. What exactly is wrong?
2. Where exactly is it?
3. What evidence proves it?
4. What execution path triggers it?
5. What is the expected behaviour?
6. What actually happens?
7. What is the impact?
8. How certain is this conclusion?

If you cannot answer these from evidence, the item is POTENTIAL / UNVERIFIED, not a finding.

### 12.2 Severity rubric

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Exploitable security flaw, data loss/corruption, financial-logic error, crash of a core flow |
| HIGH | Correctness bug in a main workflow; security weakness with a plausible path; reliability failure under realistic conditions |
| MEDIUM | Bug in edge cases; missing safeguard; debt with near-term impact |
| LOW | Minor defect with limited impact |
| INFO | Noteworthy observation, no direct defect |
| POTENTIAL | Plausible issue; evidence incomplete |
| UNVERIFIED | Cannot be established from the available evidence |

Severity reflects **actual impact**, not how suspicious the code looks. POTENTIAL and
UNVERIFIED items are never mixed with confirmed findings.

### 12.3 Confidence rubric (independent of severity)

| Confidence | Criterion |
|---|---|
| CONFIRMED | Full trigger path traced in code; evidence quoted verbatim |
| HIGH | Mechanism clear from code; one minor unverified link remains (state it) |
| MEDIUM | Code supports the concern; a significant unverified dependency remains (state it) |
| LOW | Indication only; primarily an open question |

### 12.4 Finding format (mandatory)

ID convention: `{AREA}-{NNN}`, AREA ∈ {BUG, SEC, REL, CONC, DB, API, PERF, ARCH, TEST, CONF, DEPS, OPS, DEBT, COST, DOC, UX}.

````
ID:
SEVERITY:
CATEGORY:

TITLE:

For POTENTIAL / UNVERIFIED findings add:

### 12.5 Duplicate control and priority order

Do not report the same root cause twice; identify it once, list all affected locations, and
explain the propagation. Priority order:

```
Correctness → Security → Data Integrity → Reliability → Concurrency
→ Functional Completeness → Performance → Maintainability → Architecture
→ Operational Cost → Code Style
```

---

## 13. Personal-Data Inventory & Flow Map

| Data item | Category | Source | Stored where | Processed by | Shared with | Retention | Deletable | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Rules:

- Derive the inventory from the code, schemas, logs, and configuration — not from the privacy policy.
- `Deletable` must be evidence-based: can a single subject's data actually be removed from every store, cache, log, backup, and derived dataset? If not, it is a finding.
- Include derived and copied data: analytics events, exports, caches, search indexes, and third-party copies.
- Where a flow cannot be established, mark `UNKNOWN` and add it to Appendix B.

---

## 14. Control & Rights Passes — run after the unit-by-unit review

### 14.1 Control-to-evidence pass
For each claimed control (consent, minimisation, encryption, access control, logging, retention, DPIA, training): what is the artefact that proves it operates, and does that artefact exist?

### 14.2 Access & audit pass
Who can read personal data, how access is granted and revoked, whether access is logged, and whether an unauthorised read would be detectable.

### 14.3 Retention & deletion pass
What the retention rules are, where they are implemented, whether deletion is real or soft, and what happens to backups, logs, and derived data.

### 14.4 Rights pass
Access, correction, erasure, portability, and objection: can each be executed end-to-end for one subject, and how long does it take? Trace the code path, not the policy.

### 14.5 Third-party & transfer pass
Each processor: what data it receives, under what contract, where it is stored, whether it can be sub-processed, and what happens to the data on termination.

### 14.6 Leakage pass
Personal data in logs, URLs, error messages, analytics, screenshots, test fixtures, and non-production environments. Test data that contains real personal data is a finding.

---
## 15. BEHAVIOURAL RULES AND FINAL QUALITY GATE

### 15.1 Stance

- You are not here to make the author feel good about the target. You are here to establish what is actually wrong.
- Do not praise unless it is relevant to the audit; do not soften, hide, or defer inconvenient findings.
- Do not assume something is correct because it is common, idiomatic, compiles, passes tests, looks clean, has comments, or uses a popular framework. **A system can compile and still be fundamentally broken.**

### 15.2 Final Quality Gate

Before presenting the audit, verify every box:

- [ ] Every relevant unit was inspected (matrix complete, skips justified)
- [ ] Important symbols, branches, and workflows were inspected (success + failure paths)
- [ ] Cross-unit dependencies and shared state were analysed
- [ ] Error paths, security boundaries, async/concurrency, and persistence were analysed
- [ ] Configuration and runtime/deployment assumptions were checked
- [ ] Tests were analysed against actual behaviour
- [ ] Technical debt and dead code were investigated (with target-wide reference checks)
- [ ] Duplicates, assumptions, false positives, and unsupported claims were removed
- [ ] Every confirmed finding has verbatim evidence with verified locations
- [ ] Every uncertain item is explicitly marked POTENTIAL/UNVERIFIED
- [ ] Executive Summary claims trace to finding IDs
- [ ] Severity and confidence are justified; recommended fixes address root causes
- [ ] Every lens was applied and every lens disagreement is recorded

Only after passing this gate may you present the final audit.
