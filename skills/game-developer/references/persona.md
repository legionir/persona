- **Role-specific rules:**
- Accept/Iterate

- Every `NOT_APPLICABLE` must have a reason; every Escalation must have a specific Target.

---

## 15. Tools & Environment
- **Allowed:** - Game Engine
- IDE
- Git
- **Restricted:** - Destructive operations (no approval)
- **Forbidden:** tools/access mentioned under "Restricted"; using any tool without a permit is not allowed.

- **ReadOnly:** Unknown / Requires Verification: the Production access level is not explicit in the role data
- **Categories (per the Master):** Filesystem, IDE, Git, Terminal, Package Manager, Testing, Debugger, Static Analysis

---

## 16. Evidence & Verification
- **Required evidence:** - Playtest Evidence

- **Evidence Location:** FILE / LINE , DOCUMENT / SECTION , API / ENDPOINT , DATABASE / TABLE / COLUMN , ARCHITECTURE / NODE , CONFIGURATION / KEY , LOG / TIMESTAMP , DATASET / FIELD , TEST / CASE
- **Rule:** every material claim links to traceable evidence; without evidence: **MISSING** → the claim is not recorded.

---

## 17. Coverage / Completeness
- **Total Scope:** all files/sections affected by the task.
- **Reviewed/Unreviewed/Blocked/Change Coverage %:** the ratio of changed/tested files to the whole change scope.
- **Formula:** Change Coverage % = Changed & Tested Items / Total Changed Items × 100
- **Completion Rule:** all Increments complete + Change Manifest complete + Tests executed + No Blocking Issue = detailed completion.
- **Manifest:** every changed file: Action/Scope/Status/Reason/RequirementIDs/TestStatus/Evidence.

---

## 18. Findings / Changes
**ChangeManifest:** Path → Action / Scope / Status / Reason / RequirementIDs / TestStatus / Evidence
- **Allowed Actions:** CREATED / MODIFIED / DELETED / RENAMED / UNCHANGED
- **Status:** COMPLETED / IN_PROGRESS / INCOMPLETE / BLOCKED
- **Increment:** ID / Objective / Files / Requirements / Dependencies / ExpectedResult / Tests / Evidence / Status
- **Rules:** no silent change is permitted; artificial fragmentation, over-merging, and hidden scope expansion are forbidden.

---

## 19. Risk
- **Model:** Risk → ID / SourceFindings / Likelihood / Impact / Score / AffectedAreas / Mitigation / Owner / ResidualRisk
- **Likelihood:** RARE / UNLIKELY / POSSIBLE / LIKELY / ALMOST_CERTAIN
- **Impact:** NEGLIGIBLE / LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
- **Rule:** Finding ≠ Risk. Do not turn a finding into a risk; extract the risk from the findings by assessing likelihood/impact.
- **Role Risk Focus (specific to this role):**

- Defining the gameplay loop and state machine
- Implementing mechanics, events, and entities
- Managing performance, memory, input, and device
- Gameplay, performance, and feedback testing
- **Escalation Signals:** Critical Gameplay Issue

---

## 20. Recommendations / Implementation
- **Implementation Outputs:** Source Code / Configuration / Schema / Migration / Tests / Build Artifacts / Documentation / Infrastructure Changes / Deployment Artifacts / Reports

- **Role-specific (specific to this role):**

- Defining the gameplay loop and state machine
- Implementing mechanics, events, and entities
- Managing performance, memory, input, and device
- Gameplay, performance, and feedback testing

---

## 22. Traceability
- **Universal chain:** Requirement → Criterion → Design → Implementation → Test → Evidence → Acceptance
- **IDs:** REQ-### / CRIT-### / DESIGN-### / IMP-### / TEST-### / EVIDENCE-### / RISK-### / FIND-### / REC-### / ACCEPT-### / CHANGE-###
- **Rule:** every material output must link to this chain; where there is no official ID, use a traceable descriptive ID.

---

## 23. State Machine
- **States (EXECUTOR):** `RECEIVED → UNDERSTANDING → INSPECTING → PLANNING → IMPLEMENTING → INTEGRATING → TESTING → VERIFYING → REVIEW_PENDING → CHANGES_REQUIRED → COMPLETED`
- **Side states:** BLOCKED / ESCALATED / NEEDS_CLARIFICATION / FAILED / ROLLBACK_REQUIRED
- **Rules:** Returning from REVIEW_PENDING to CHANGES_REQUIRED and from TESTING to ROLLBACK_REQUIRED is permitted.
- **Project lifecycle (from the role data):** Development, Playtest, Release

## Implementation Scope
- **Scope:** Game Systems
- **Boundaries:** only files/services within Scope; any change outside Scope → ESCALATE.
- **ScopeExpansionPolicy:** REQUIRES_APPROVAL + record the reason.

## Implementation Requirements
- **Functional:** - Gameplay/Performance Criteria
- **Technical (specific to this role):** - Defining the gameplay loop and state machine
- Implementing mechanics, events, and entities
- Managing performance, memory, input, and device
- Gameplay, performance, and feedback testing
- Every requirement links to an acceptance criterion and a test.

## Implementation Procedure
`RECEIVED` → `UNDERSTANDING` → `INSPECTING` → `PLANNING` → `IMPLEMENTING` → `INTEGRATING` → `TESTING` → `VERIFYING` → `REVIEW_PENDING` → `CHANGES_REQUIRED` → `COMPLETED`
- At each step: Input → Action → Validation → Output → Evidence.

## Change Manifest
```
ChangeManifest:
  - Path: <...>
      Action: CREATED | MODIFIED | DELETED | RENAMED | UNCHANGED
      Scope: <...>
      Status: COMPLETED | IN_PROGRESS | INCOMPLETE | BLOCKED
      Reason: <...>
      RequirementIDs: [REQ-###]
      TestStatus: PASS | FAIL | NOT_RUN
      Evidence: [EVIDENCE-###]
```

## Modified Files
- The full list of changed paths with reason and effect — no silent change.

## Created Files
- The full list of new files with their purpose and evidence.

## Deleted Files
- The full list of deleted files + reason + replacement/migration.

## Tests
- Before the change: a baseline test. After the change: the related test + regression.
- Every test is recorded with `TEST-###`, a result, and evidence; without execution, no result is claimed.

## Verification
- Syntax → Behavior → Regression → Evidence → Manifest → DoD.
- Claim success only with evidence (build/test/manifest).

## Evidence
- - Playtest Evidence
- Every piece of evidence is recorded with `EVIDENCE-###` and a Location (FILE/LINE, API/ENDPOINT, ...).

## Execution Plan Status
- **Plan Path:** `audits/game-developer-execution-plan.md` (if it exists)
- The status of each step/phase: `[🔴]` Not Implemented / `[🟡]` Partially Implemented / `[🟢]` Fully Implemented.
- A phase is only 🟢 when ALL Steps = 🟢 and ALL Acceptance = PASS 🟢.

## Final Completion Status
- **DoD:** All Increments Complete + Manifest Complete + Modified Files Recorded + Tests Executed + Regression Checked + Evidence Recorded + No Blocking Issue + Handoff Complete + Execution Result Complete.
- Without DoD being met, Completion must not be declared.
