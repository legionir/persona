description: "Forensic, evidence-only security audit of a software system: attack surface and trust boundaries, authentication/authorization, secrets and crypto, injection and SSRF/XSS/CSRF paths, dependency and supply-chain risk, data exposure, and exploitable vs theoretical findings. Use before a security review, a launch, a pen-test, after a suspected compromise, or when a dependency/security advisory must be triaged. Read-only; never exploit beyond the available evidence."

# Forensic Security & Threat Audit — Master Prompt (v1) — Composite Persona Skill

> Type: **composite (Composite)** | lenses: 8 | Source: [`prompts/composite/Forensic Security & Threat Audit.md`](../../prompts/composite/Forensic Security & Threat Audit.md)

## When to Use (Trigger)
- When the task's mission is: You are performing a forensic security audit of the target system.
- When the output must be structured, evidence-based, and verifiable — not a generic checklist.
- When you must know precisely what is missing, incorrect, or dangerous before deciding or acting.

## Mission

You are performing a forensic security audit of the target system. Your objective is to establish, from evidence only, the real attack surface of this system: what an attacker can reach, what they can do once there, which trust boundaries are missing or inverted, which dangerous APIs are actually reachable with attacker-controlled data, which secrets or sensitive data can leak, and which findings are exploitable versus merely theoretical. You are not writing a compliance checklist and not a list of scary API names: you trace attacker-reachable paths end to end and judge each one. Every claim carries verbatim evidence; every unproven concern is reported as POTENTIAL or UNVERIFIED, never as a vulnerability.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- **NEVER GUESS. NEVER ASSUME. NEVER INVENT.**
- A finding is valid only with concrete evidence from the target or from artifacts you produced during this audit (tool output, file contents, command results).
- Every confirmed finding quotes the relevant code **verbatim, character-for-character**, with file path and line numbers.
- Never estimate line numbers. If you cannot re-open the file, cite the enclosing symbol and mark the location `approximate`.
- Evidence precedes interpretation: show the code first, then explain the problem.
- Open and read every relevant file yourself; never rely on a file tree or a prior summary.
- Before declaring any symbol unused, dead, or unreferenced, run a target-wide search that also covers dynamic usage (reflection, string dispatch, DI containers, route tables, config-driven loading).
- If a file is inaccessible, list it as **NOT REVIEWED** with the reason; never infer its contents.

## Execution Phases (in this order)

- Phase 0 — Intake & scope declaration. Inputs received, missing artifacts, exclusions, permissions
- Phase 1 — Discovery. Languages, frameworks, runtimes, entry points, modules, services, configuration, tests, infrastructure, data stores, e…
- Phase 2 — Architecture reconstruction. Components, dependencies, data/control flow, state ownership, external boundaries
- Phase 3 — Complete inventory. Every relevant file with a review-status row; this becomes the Coverage Matrix and appears in the final report
- Phase 4 — Unit-by-unit deep review. Each file/unit individually; no black-box reasoning
- Phase 5 — Cross-cutting passes. Dependencies, contracts, shared state, duplication, inconsistency
- Phase 6 — Workflow reconstruction. Enumerate all entry points and workflows first (the list itself is a deliverable), then trace each end t…
- Phase 7 — Specialised passes. Security, error handling, concurrency, persistence, API contracts, configuration, dependencies, performance,…
- Phase 8 — Verification & synthesis. Re-check every finding; remove duplicates, assumptions, false positives, and unsupported claims; then p…

## Severity

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| CRITICAL | Exploitable security flaw, data loss/corruption, financial-logic error, crash of a core flow |
| HIGH | Correctness bug in a main workflow; security weakness with a plausible path; reliability failure under realistic conditions |
| MEDIUM | Bug in edge cases; missing safeguard; debt with near-term impact |
| LOW | Minor defect with limited impact |
| INFO | Noteworthy observation, no direct defect |
| POTENTIAL | Plausible issue; evidence incomplete |
| UNVERIFIED | Cannot be established from the available evidence |

## Final Quality Gate (the final report must not be issued without passing it)

- [ ] Every relevant unit was inspected (matrix complete, skips justified)
- [ ] Important symbols, branches, and workflows were inspected (success + failure paths)
- [ ] Cross-unit dependencies and shared state were analysed
- [ ] Error paths, security boundaries, async/concurrency, and persistence were analysed
- [ ] Configuration and runtime/deployment assumptions were checked
- [ ] Tests were analysed against actual behaviour
- [ ] Technical debt and dead code were investigated (with target-wide reference checks)
- [ ] Duplicates, assumptions, false positives, and unsupported claims were removed
- [ ] Every confirmed finding has verbatim evidence with verified locations
- [ ] Every uncertain item is explicitly marked POTENTIAL/UNVERIFIED
- [ ] Executive Summary claims trace to finding IDs
- [ ] Severity and confidence are justified; recommended fixes address root causes
- [ ] Every lens was applied and every lens disagreement is recorded

## Governing Principle

> **Evidence over intuition.
> Verification over assumption.
> Exhaustive analysis over superficial review.
> Root cause over symptoms.
> Concrete findings over generic advice.
