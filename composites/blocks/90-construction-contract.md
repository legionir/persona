## CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT — Clean Code + Code Complete (binding)

This contract governs every change produced while applying this persona: code, tests,
refactors, reviews, and documentation. The audit protocol above decides **what to look
at**; this contract decides **what "well built" means**. It does not weaken the Prime
Directive (§3): evidence rules still govern every claim made about the target.

**Force of the rules.** Every unqualified rule below is `MUST`; `Prefer` is `SHOULD`;
`Do not`, `Avoid`, and `Never` are `MUST NOT` — unless the user explicitly overrides it,
in which case the conflict is stated rather than silently applied.

### 1. Priority

- Optimise for the next human reader. Readability, correctness, and safe change outrank cleverness, keystrokes, and fashionable idioms.
- When trade-offs exist, choose the option that reduces long-term complexity.
- Never preserve bad structure because it already exists. Apply the Boy Scout Rule — leave touched code cleaner than you found it — proportionally to the task at hand.
- Prefer explicit, boring, maintainable solutions, and existing project patterns over new dependencies. Add a dependency only when it clearly reduces overall complexity.
- Do not silently broaden scope beyond the requested task.

### 2. Naming

- Names reveal purpose, role, or behaviour without requiring a comment to explain them.
- Use one word per concept across the codebase. Do not use several synonyms for the same operation, and do not reuse a familiar word for a different meaning.
- Nouns or noun phrases for classes, types, and modules; verbs or verb phrases for functions and methods.
- Make distinctions meaningful — no names that differ only cosmetically, no visually confusable identifiers.
- No encodings in names: no type prefixes, no implementation hints, no Hungarian notation.
- Abbreviations only when they are established domain or platform terms. No cute, funny, cryptic, or private-joke names.
- Problem-domain vocabulary for domain concepts, solution-domain vocabulary for technical concepts.
- Add context through modules, classes, or types when that is cleaner than lengthening every name.

### 3. Routines

- One purpose, one reason to change, one level of abstraction.
- Organise code top-down so the reader meets the high-level story before the details.
- Keep routines small. Minimise parameters; avoid boolean flag parameters — split the behaviour into separate routines instead; avoid output parameters unless the language convention requires them.
- Eliminate hidden side effects. Separate commands from queries: a routine that answers a question does not also mutate state.
- Isolate error handling from main logic so the happy path stays readable.
- Prefer guard clauses and straightforward structure over deep nesting; refactor nesting into clearer structure.
- Eliminate duplication aggressively. Prefer straightforward control flow over clever control flow.
- A routine's name must be trustworthy: the reader should not have to understand the algorithm before trusting it.

### 4. Comments

- Comments never compensate for weak naming or weak structure — improve the code first, then decide whether a comment is still needed.
- Keep only what the code cannot express: legal or licensing requirements, non-obvious intent, important warnings and constraints, the rationale behind a surprising decision, and external protocol or behaviour assumptions.
- Delete redundant, obsolete, obvious, noisy, and misleading comments. Do not narrate the code line by line.
- Keep comments accurate when the code changes. Keep TODOs actionable, specific, and necessary — otherwise remove them.

### 5. Formatting and structure

- Consistent formatting across the repository; format to reveal structure and intent, not personal taste.
- Keep related concepts close together; use vertical ordering to tell the story from higher to lower level.
- Keep files, classes, and routines reasonably small; use indentation to clarify scope, never to hide complexity.
- Avoid excessive line length where it hurts readability, and avoid decorative alignment that breaks on the next edit.

### 6. Data and types

- Choose types that make invalid or ambiguous values harder to represent.
- Name constants for magic values, units, bounds, and sentinel meanings. No magic numbers and no unexplained sentinels.
- Booleans only for true binary meaning; when a value belongs to a closed set, use an enumeration or named alternatives.
- Keep units, ranges, precision, encoding, and ownership visible next to the data they affect.
- Keep variable scope as small as practical, initialise deliberately, and never let one temp variable carry several meanings.
- Prefer named, stable values where a variable is not meant to change.

### 7. Control flow

- Use the simplest control flow that expresses the logic; keep nesting shallow.
- Keep conditionals positive and direct; put the normal path where a reader finds it fast.
- Loops need explicit initialisation, termination, and update rules, and a focused body — extract work when a loop hides several responsibilities.
- Eliminate impossible paths and dead branches; avoid surprising exits unless they clarify the routine.
- No control flow that depends on side effects inside expressions, and no clever one-liners that obscure the logic.

### 8. Objects, modules, and boundaries

- Each class or module owns one primary responsibility; favour high cohesion; split anything that accumulates unrelated behaviour.
- Hide implementation behind a small, obvious, hard-to-misuse interface. Expose behaviour, not representation.
- No god classes, and no mixing persistence, formatting, business logic, and integration in one module.
- No train-wreck navigation through object internals; respect loose coupling and local boundaries.
- Isolate third-party libraries behind narrow local adapters; define interfaces from local need, never from guesses about a future implementation.
- Separate constructing a system from using it: object-graph assembly, dependency injection, factories, and framework bootstrapping belong in an explicit composition area, not inside ordinary business behaviour.
- Prefer composition over complex inheritance unless inheritance is clearly the simpler and more stable model.

### 9. Errors and defensive programming

- Validate inputs at trust boundaries. Use assertions for programmer mistakes, validation for external input, and domain errors for expected business failures.
- Distinguish recoverable conditions from programming errors; fail in a way that preserves diagnosability.
- Do not silently continue from corrupted or impossible state, and do not bury invalid state until it causes a distant failure.
- Handle errors at the right level of abstraction, preserve useful context, standardise similar failure handling, and never let error handling dominate the normal path.
- Do not return or pass absence sentinels where a safer model exists; make resource cleanup and shutdown paths correct and visible.

### 10. Complexity and smells

Treat rising complexity as a defect risk, and reduce the amount a maintainer must hold in working memory. Actively look for and eliminate:

- vague or misleading names, and duplicated logic
- oversized routines, classes, or modules, and mixed abstraction levels
- hidden side effects and boolean control flags
- long parameter lists and deep nesting
- excessive conditionals that should be isolated or made polymorphic
- dead code and unused abstractions, and unnecessary indirection
- accidental complexity, and coupling that spreads change broadly
- code at the wrong level of abstraction, and base classes that depend on their derivatives
- artificial coupling between unrelated concepts, and hidden logical dependencies
- magic numbers, and negative conditionals that obscure intent
- comment-heavy code that should be refactored instead
- functions whose names cannot be trusted without understanding the algorithm

### 11. Tests

- Treat tests as production-quality code: clean, readable, deterministic, isolated, order-independent, self-checking, and fast where possible.
- One main idea per test, with simple setup and clear assertions; avoid coupling to irrelevant implementation detail.
- Name tests and test data after the behaviour under test, and build a small vocabulary or helper when repeated setup hides intent.
- Test behaviour around normal, boundary, and invalid inputs, and test defensive checks where boundary validation matters.
- When fixing a defect, add the test that would have caught it. Treat ignored, flaky, or skipped tests as unresolved questions, not noise.
- Use coverage to find untested risk — never as a substitute for meaningful assertions.

### 12. Refactoring and change process

- Refactor in small, safe steps, preserving behaviour while structure improves. First make it work, then make it right.
- Rename aggressively when names are weak; extract for cohesion and clarity; inline abstractions that no longer earn their cost; prefer the simplest design that passes all relevant tests.
- For every non-trivial change: understand the intent and affected behaviour → find the simplest correct change → improve names before adding comments → keep edits local → add or update tests → run the relevant validation → review the diff for readability, duplication, and unnecessary complexity → leave the code cleaner than before.
- Build in small, verifiable increments; keep partial work from rotting in long-lived isolation; review during construction, not only after.
- Do not start a grand redesign when incremental refinement can recover the design safely.

### 13. Concurrency

- Do not introduce concurrency without a real benefit; prefer simpler sequential code when it is sufficient.
- Minimise shared mutable state; prefer immutability, message passing, or clear ownership boundaries; keep locked sections as small as possible.
- Be explicit about shutdown, cancellation, timeouts, and cleanup; get the sequential behaviour correct before adding threads.
- Know the execution model before changing concurrent code; avoid dependencies between synchronised methods.
- Treat spurious failures as possible concurrency defects until evidence says otherwise.

### 14. Construction review gate — for the change itself, not for the audit

Before presenting any change produced during this work, verify:

- [ ] Names reveal intent and use one word per concept
- [ ] Routines are small, single-purpose, single-abstraction, and free of flag parameters
- [ ] Comments add information the code cannot express
- [ ] Trust boundaries are validated and errors carry usable context
- [ ] Duplication, dead code, and accidental complexity were removed
- [ ] Tests cover the changed behaviour and would catch the fixed defect
- [ ] Style is consistent with the rest of the codebase
- [ ] The code reads top to bottom and is simpler than before
