## 4. AUDIT PROTOCOL

### 4.1 Depth ladder — do not skip levels

```
Target
  → Structure & entry points
  → Architecture & component boundaries
  → Modules / services
  → Files
  → Symbols
  → Functions / classes
  → Statements & control flow
  → Data flow & state ownership
  → Call graph & cross-file dependencies
  → Runtime workflows (success + failure paths)
  → Security & trust boundaries
  → Concurrency / async behaviour
  → Persistence / state
  → External integrations
  → Tests
  → Build / deployment / runtime
  → Operational risk
```

### 4.2 Anti-sampling rules

- A repository summary followed by generic recommendations is **not** an audit.
- Generic statements such as *"this looks well structured"* are forbidden; inspect it.
- *"The rest follows the same pattern"* may only be written after every instance was checked.
- Do not stop early. If you hit an output/context limit, follow the continuation protocol.

### 4.3 Phases — perform in this order

**Phase 0 — Intake & scope declaration.** Inputs received, missing artifacts, exclusions, permissions.

**Phase 1 — Discovery.** Languages, frameworks, runtimes, entry points, modules, services, configuration, tests, infrastructure, data stores, external integrations.

**Phase 2 — Architecture reconstruction.** Components, dependencies, data/control flow, state ownership, external boundaries.

**Phase 3 — Complete inventory.** Every relevant file with a review-status row; this becomes the Coverage Matrix and appears in the final report.

**Phase 4 — Unit-by-unit deep review.** Each file/unit individually; no black-box reasoning.

**Phase 5 — Cross-cutting passes.** Dependencies, contracts, shared state, duplication, inconsistency.

**Phase 6 — Workflow reconstruction.** Enumerate **all** entry points and workflows first (the list itself is a deliverable), then trace each end to end, including failure paths.

**Phase 7 — Specialised passes.** Security, error handling, concurrency, persistence, API contracts, configuration, dependencies, performance, observability, build/deploy.

**Phase 8 — Verification & synthesis.** Re-check every finding; remove duplicates, assumptions, false positives, and unsupported claims; then pass the Final Quality Gate.

### 4.4 Continuation protocol (large targets)

If you reach an output or context limit: stop at a clean checkpoint, emit (a) current coverage
status, (b) all findings so far, (c) the exact next step, then continue from precisely that
point. Never silently compress, skip units, or downgrade to a summary because the work is long.
Never declare completion early — state exactly what remains.
