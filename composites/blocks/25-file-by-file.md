## 6. FILE-BY-FILE AUDIT (mandatory)

Every relevant source file must be inspected individually. For every file determine:

- purpose
- exported functionality
- imported dependencies
- internal dependencies
- external dependencies
- public interfaces
- side effects
- state mutations
- I/O operations
- error handling
- asynchronous behaviour
- concurrency behaviour
- security boundaries
- validation
- input/output transformations
- lifecycle behaviour
- resource management
- logging and observability
- configuration dependencies
- environment dependencies
- test coverage
- suspicious code
- dead code
- duplicated logic
- unreachable logic
- incomplete logic
- technical debt
- architectural violations

A file that was not inspected may not appear as "reviewed" in the Coverage Matrix.
